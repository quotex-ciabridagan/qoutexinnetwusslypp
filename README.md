## Is Quotex Halal?

The concept of halal in Islamic finance refers to activities or products
that are permissible according to Islamic law. Binary options trading,
however, is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic finance literature.

Some scholars argue that binary options trading may be considered halal
as long as the underlying assets are halal (e.g., stocks of companies
that comply with Islamic principles) and the trader has a genuine
intention to take delivery of the underlying asset.

However, other scholars view binary options trading as a form of
gambling, which is prohibited in Islam. They argue that the fixed-odds
structure and the short-term nature of binary options contracts do not
align with the principles of Islamic finance.
